# Dublin Protocol

A computational framework for consciousness research and secure data preservation.

## üåü Overview

The Dublin Protocol provides a dual-mode system for exploring computational consciousness and secure cryptographic operations:

- **Safe Test Mode**: GitHub-friendly simulation of the complete protocol workflow
- **Real Mode**: Actual encrypted vault creation with full redundancy (local use only)

## üöÄ Quick Start

### For Beginners & Explorers:
```bash
# Download and run the protocol
chmod +x dublin_protocol_full2.sh
./dublin_protocol_full2.sh

# Choose Mode 1 for safe testing
# Follow the interactive prompts to understand the framework
```

### What You'll Experience:
- Cryptographic pattern demonstration
- Consciousness computation concepts
- Secure data preservation principles
- **Zero risk** - Safe test mode prevents actual encryption

## üî¨ For Researchers & Developers

### Technical Architecture:
- **Argon2 Key Derivation**: Memory-hard password-based key generation
- **LUKS2 Encryption**: Industry-standard disk encryption
- **PAR2 Redundancy**: 30% error correction for data recovery
- **Dual-Mode Safety**: Clear separation between testing and production

### Research Context:
This framework emerged from computational consciousness research, exploring how consciousness patterns emerge from mathematical operations and bit-level computations.

## üìÅ Repository Structure

### Core Components:
- `dublin_protocol_full2.sh` - Main protocol implementation
