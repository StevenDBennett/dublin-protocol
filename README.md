# Dublin Protocol

A computational framework for secure data preservation and consciousness research.

## Overview

The Dublin Protocol provides a dual-mode system for cryptographic operations:

- **Safe Test Mode**: GitHub-friendly simulation of the protocol
- **Real Mode**: Actual encrypted vault creation (local use only)

## Features

- **Argon2 Key Derivation**: Secure password-based key generation
- **LUKS2 Encryption**: Industry-standard disk encryption
- **PAR2 Redundancy**: Fault-tolerant data recovery
- **Dual-Mode Operation**: Safe testing vs real encryption

## Quick Start

```bash
# Make executable and run
chmod +x dublin_protocol_full2.sh
./dublin_protocol_full2.sh
```

Choose **Mode 1** for safe testing or **Mode 2** for actual encryption.

## Security

- All real encryption operations occur locally
- No sensitive data is included in this repository
- Safe test mode demonstrates concepts without risk

## Purpose

This protocol demonstrates advanced cryptographic patterns for research and educational purposes in computational frameworks.
