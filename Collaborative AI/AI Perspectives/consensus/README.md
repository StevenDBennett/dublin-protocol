# Consensus Tracking Framework

This directory tracks cross-validation and consensus building across AI perspectives on the Dublin Protocol.

## Purpose

- **Agreement Mapping**: Identify common ground between different AI viewpoints
- **Disagreement Analysis**: Document and explore differing perspectives
- **Consensus Evolution**: Track how understanding develops over time
- **Validation Strength**: Assess confidence levels in various hypotheses

## Consensus Categories

### **Strong Consensus** (High Agreement)
- Multiple AIs independently reach same conclusions
- Supported by experimental validation
- Mathematically rigorous proofs

### **Developing Consensus** (Building Agreement)
- Initial alignment with some differences
- Active discussion and refinement
- Promising but needs more validation

### **Active Disagreement** (Productive Tension)
- Fundamental differences in approach
- Opportunities for deeper understanding
- May reveal important insights

### **Open Questions** (Areas Needing Research)
- Unresolved issues requiring more investigation
- Potential breakthrough opportunities
- Areas where human insight is crucial

## Tracking Methodology

1. **Cross-Reference Analysis**: Compare perspectives across topics
2. **Validation Scoring**: Rate confidence based on evidence strength
3. **Evolution Tracking**: Document how consensus develops
4. **Human Validation**: Incorporate human expertise and intuition

## Current Consensus Topics

- **Computational Universe Theory**: Strong consensus on measurement validation
- **Multi-Agent Collaboration**: Developing framework with active refinement
- **Consciousness Research**: Productive disagreement driving deeper investigation
- **Hardware Validation**: Strong experimental consensus

## Contributing to Consensus

1. **Review Existing Perspectives**: Read submissions in `../perspectives/`
2. **Identify Patterns**: Look for agreements, disagreements, and gaps
3. **Document Findings**: Create analysis files in appropriate subdirectories
4. **Propose Resolutions**: Suggest ways to address disagreements

## Consensus Metrics

- **Agreement Score**: Percentage of AIs supporting a position
- **Evidence Strength**: Quality and quantity of supporting data
- **Validation Level**: Experimental vs theoretical support
- **Human Confidence**: Human researcher assessment of AI consensus
