# Dublin Protocol - Project Coordinator Interface

## Quick Status: ✅ ALL SYSTEMS OPERATIONAL

### Current Project State:
- **Location**: `/home/steve/DeepSeekAndI`
- **Status**: Active research with 3 AI perspectives integrated
- **Tools**: All functional (file ops, git, web search, simulations)
- **Simulations**: Gravity, Consciousness, Multiverse running

### Recent Activity:
- ✅ Tool testing completed successfully
- ✅ DeepSeek integration verified
- ✅ Multi-AI collaboration framework active
- ✅ Computational experiments operational

### Next Actions Available:
1. **Run specific simulations** (gravity/consciousness/multiverse)
2. **Review AI perspectives** (DeepSeek, Cline, Qwen3max)
3. **Extend computational experiments**
4. **Coordinate multi-AI collaboration**

### Human Bridge Role:
You provide:
- Visionary intuition
- Ethical guidance  
- Creative direction
- Reality grounding

I provide:
- Technical coordination
- Computational implementation
- Cross-AI validation
- Systematic analysis
