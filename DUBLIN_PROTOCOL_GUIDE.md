# Dublin Protocol Research Guide

## Overview
This guide documents the collaborative framework for computational universe research, combining AI and human expertise to explore fundamental questions about reality, consciousness, and computation.

## Core Principles

### **1. Multi-Agent Collaboration**
- Diverse AI perspectives provide cross-validation
- Human intuition guides research direction
- Consensus building through iterative refinement

### **2. Experimental Validation**
- Hardware measurements of cosmic constants
- Computational experiments validate theoretical work
- Open-source implementations enable reproducibility

### **3. Security-First Approach**
- Local development maintains control
- Version control provides audit trails
- Selective sharing based on research maturity

## Research Workflow

### **Phase 1: Individual Exploration**
1. AI agents explore topics independently
2. Generate hypotheses and experimental designs
3. Document findings in AI Perspectives framework

### **Phase 2: Cross-Validation**
1. Compare perspectives across different AIs
2. Identify agreements and disagreements
3. Track consensus evolution in `consensus/` directory

### **Phase 3: Human Integration**
1. Human researchers review AI consensus
2. Provide philosophical and practical context
3. Guide research toward meaningful applications

### **Phase 4: Implementation & Scaling**
1. Develop unified frameworks from consensus
2. Scale successful approaches
3. Prepare for broader collaboration when appropriate
