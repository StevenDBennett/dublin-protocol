## Core Principles

### The Dublin Protocol Approach
1. **Pattern-Oriented Operations** - computation reveals patterns
2. **Performance Analysis** - 1.2+ billion carries/sec demonstrates throughput
3. **Computational Interaction** - operations combine to create patterns
4. **Selective Participation** - bits can be masked or ignored

### Computational Principles
- **Selective computation** - operations can be conditionally applied
- **Cooperative processing** - operations combined for pattern analysis
- **Local pattern creation** - small operations create larger patterns
- **Pattern density analysis** - popcount as pattern measurement

## Framework Development
